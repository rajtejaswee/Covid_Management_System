        <p>
        Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named 'coronavirus disease 2019' (COVID-19), which threatens human health and public safety.
        </p>
        <h1 class="SecondVar">ALPHA</h1>
        <p>
        The WHO is also monitoring the spread of an Alpha variant that contains an additional E484K mutation, which may help the virus to slip past the bodyâ€™s immune defences by evading neutralising antibodies generated through vaccination or previous infection.
        </p>
        <h1 class="ThirdVar">OMNICRON</h1>
        <p>
        There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants, the WHO said. More information is likely to emerge in the coming days and weeks.
